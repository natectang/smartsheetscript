# smartsheetscript
Large Enterprise TSE Scripting Challenge

This challenge showcases my ability to write a script in the language of my choice: Node.js. Using the Smartsheet Node.js SDK, I created a script that can generate a new
sheet and then cell link rows from a static sheet (Sheet A) onto the newly created sheet (Sheet B).

What the script does:
1. Create a New Sheet (Sheet B)
2. Add five rows to Sheet B
3. Creates Cell-Links from five rows on Sheet A to the new rows on Sheet B
